~~~~~~~~~~~~~
``scvi-tools`` (single-cell variational inference tools) is a package for end-to-end analysis of single-cell omics data primarily developed and maintained by the `Yosef Lab
<https://yoseflab.github.io/>`_ at UC Berkeley. ``scvi-tools`` has two components

* Interface for easy use of a range of probabilistic models for single-cell omics (e.g., scVI, scANVI, totalVI).
* Tools to build new probabilistic models, which are powered by PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning, and Pyro.

If you find a model useful for your research, please consider citing the corresponding publication, which can be found in the corresponding model documentation.
